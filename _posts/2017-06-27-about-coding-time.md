That’s right: it is better later than never. I am returning to my blog writing once again. I had a long discussion with myself about whether I should or should not start a blog of my own. During my ongoing pre-course at the Makers Academy, I have discovered that TIME is valuable and should be used wisely. Nothing I start I can finish, just because I don't have enough time. 

Choosing to work during the first weeks of pre-course was a pretty dumb decision because a number of hours spent over the code challenges exceed the recommended 20 hours per week. I can convince anyone arguing this point that you will need much more than that. If you ask me why, I would say that even if the pre-course is designed for complete beginners, you would still need a good foundation and extra online tutorials coupled with books to grasp all the fundamental programming concepts hidden behind the scene. 

I am still working full-time, not to mention my current role which has nothing to do with coding. Hence, I struggle. I struggle to find time to fill the gaps in my knowledge and do some extra reading. The last one is crucial when it comes to learning how to code.

Regarding the books, it is heavy reading, check this out yourself. These are brilliant works written by experienced programmers: 

- A Well-Grounded Rubyist  by David A. Black - 506 pages, plus exercises 

- Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby by Sandi Metz - 247 pages, plus exercises 

Don't expect to read them in one day, remember it would take time! 

During your four weeks of the course you will cover the following: 

Test Driven Development - [wiki intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)

Ruby  - [wiki intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language))

Command Line - [wiki intro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

Git & GitHub - [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI)

These are the core bits, that you will cover, on top of these many others, such as solving Kata challenges, meditating over the code on Ruby Koans, writing your first command line application, brushing your CV, getting familiar with various test editors, including VIM, and occasionally meeting with your mentor or cohort to practice all of the above. 

On Friday of the very first week, I realised that I am way behind and have not gone any far with a weekly challenge. After work, my brain gets too tired and can not focus, so I have to spend the entire weekend at home, hitting my head against the wall. The good news is I managed to submit everything on time. At the weekends, I did my very best to utilise as much time as I could and practice writing the code all day long. Coding for 12 hours straight would not probably be the smartest idea, so I made a lot of breaks - for morning tea, for breakfast, for lunch, for Insta check, for calling my mom and for dinner.  

Even if you miss a deadline, try to submit your work ASAP. Don't take it as a general piece of advice and try to finalise a project within the given timeframe.

I have learned that setting a deadline is great practice and a perfect motivator to keep yourself going.

It does work for me. The better you understand yourself the better you can manage your own time. And if you do so, I believe you will succeed at everything, including coding!

Remember the key is in not spending time, but investing in it.
